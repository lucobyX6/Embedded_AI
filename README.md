# Embedded_AI
*Abstract :* Development of a predictive AI and implementation on a STM32 Discovery Kit. 

Introduction
----------------------

**Goal :** Train a failure predictibe AI model and implement it on a STM32 Discovery Kit, to develop embedded AI for microelectronics. 

**Hardware :** Discovery kit with STM32L4R9AI MCU

#### Artificial Intelligence training

> Dataset view
> Dataset not clean 
> Overfitting and underfitting
> Correction with SMOTE
> Good results

#### Implementation with CubeAI

> CubeAI
> Code explain (not long)

### UART communication 

> Developpement of code
> Result on UART Communication
